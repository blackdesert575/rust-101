# rust-101
rust-101 for one who want to learn Rust with AI(ChatGPI...etc)/any sources from scratch and practice more.

## Quick Start

```shell
cd BRFNTP/ch01
cargo run

#compile with rustc
rustc main.rs

#with scripts
./scripts/rustc.sh BRFNTP/ch01/src/main.rs
./main
```

## to-do-list

* Adjust my self-study schedule
* Modify rust-101 dir layout
* Implementation plan
* Rust self-study progress
* Rust with any other languages(Python/Mojo/C/C++/Java/Golang/Perl/Javascript/Typescript)? (FFI/ABI/...etc)

---

## Learning Goals
- Rust basic
- coding with any crates
- refactoring or enhancemnet exist projects: [sauce-man](https://github.com/hong539/sauce-man), ansible, terraguant...etc

## Self learning timing
- hours per each week for learning: 10 hours
- hours per each day for learning: 0.5 ~ 2 hours
